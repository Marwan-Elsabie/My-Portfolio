Project name is : AR2LT 

With more than 313 Million speaker around the world and being the fifth most spoken 
language in the world, Arabic language indeed is popular, but unfortunately Arabic is still 
falling behind in the world of technology, therefore being native speakers of the language , we 
have decided to base our project mainly on developing an application which supports Arabic 
OCR , the application main idea is to capture Arabic words from images as input and 
transliterate to Latin characters as output, this shall be done using image processing techniques 
which will process the input image and segment each letter using a segmentation algorithm 
we designed after that we obtain individual sperate letters in the final step a neural network 
model is used to predict the letter and give the transliterated Latin character .
